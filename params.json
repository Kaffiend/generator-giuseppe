So if you don't already have installed yeoman, install it with:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g yo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, you need this generator. Install it in the global context as well:\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g generator-giuseppe\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis generator installs all the npm packages and typings needed for an up and running `giuseppe`\r\napplication. So another global dependency is `typings`.\r\n```bash\r\nnpm install -g typings\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter those steps, you can run yeoman with the giuseppe generator:\r\n```bash\r\nyo giuseppe\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the essential questions are answered and the corresponding project is generated for you.\r\nSo in that sense:\r\n\r\nHappy coding with [giuseppe](https://github.com/smartive/giuseppe) :smile:\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nThe changelog is based on [keep a changelog](http://keepachangelog.com) and is located here:\r\n\r\n[Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nThis software is licenced under the [MIT](LICENSE) licence.\r\n",
